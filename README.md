Introduction to Sentiment Analysis Project

Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, is a fascinating field of natural language processing (NLP) that seeks to understand and classify human sentiments expressed in text data. In today's digital age, where an enormous amount of textual information is generated daily, sentiment analysis plays a crucial role in extracting valuable insights from this data.

Our sentiment analysis project leverages the power of machine learning classifiers to discern sentiment from a diverse and mixed dataset. Unlike traditional sentiment analysis projects that focus on binary sentiment (positive/negative), we explore a richer landscape, encompassing multiple sentiment classes, including positive, neutral, and negative sentiments.
